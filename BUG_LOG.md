# Bug Report

Three types of bug I saw in this project.

    1. FE Bug
    2. BE Bug
    3. Model Bug

## FE Bug
FE Bug is very strange forward for this project. It's just "what I see is what I have". If something wrong, we can instantly see issue report on the view. Based on that issue report, we can simply fix by researching that kind of issue on the internet.

Notable bug I faced was modal popup.

## Backend Service Log

BE bug can be straight forward too if we use debugger properly. After building an api, I checked at scalar (similar to swagger) and if issue happen, it throw exception and display on vs code. Then I can check type of exception and the place that happen exception. 

Notable bug was about managing DateTimeOffset because in my previous project, I just used DateTime object but here I use DateTimeOffset and it's at most places in BE services so it's easier to create issue at that time.

Let me display bug code and my fixed code

```csharp
var weekStart = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(-7); // bug code
```

```csharp
    var weekStart = new DateTimeOffset(DateTime.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(-7), TimeSpan.Zero); //fixing code
    
```



## Model Bug

Kind of bug happened when I try to work with my model (trained at TextEmbeddingService ) that give similarity of a record. I made some similar records but not shown as similar ones.

The fix was just the training data. When I provider more relevant training data. The result generated by model made sense more.
